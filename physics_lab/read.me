# Movement of a body thrown with an angle to the horizontal, taking in account resistance of air, also resistance of air may be setted as zero.

# Input parameters: speed, angle, resistance (coefficient), mass (is needed only if resistance is not zero).

# Project made with two types of formulas. First type is usual formulas without resistance. Second type it is formulas with resistance wich is solved with # linear differential equations. With fronend it is possible to get graphics of flight length versus time, flight height versus time and flight height 
# versus flight length. User can get graphics taking into account resistance or without it. Animation of flying point is also provided. 

# Program has a safe input.

# For this project were used two extra libraries: NumPy and Plotly.
# NumPy is an open source project aiming to enable numerical computing with Python. 
# Plotly's Python graphing library makes interactive, publication-quality graphs.
# You may install both libraries with a command "pip insatall name_of_lib"

#___Downsides___#
# No Qt for input buttons.

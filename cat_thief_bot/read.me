This project is an automatic wall. I set (hardcode) certain amount of group names (domains) in main code. 
After that program parses all new posts from it and post it on wall of my community with my group name. It is just a studying project and I'm not really
interested in stealing someone posts. I chose tp parse only cat groups.
